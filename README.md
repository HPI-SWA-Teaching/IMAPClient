We proudly present our IMAP Client for Smalltalk Squeak, which we developed and improved during the summer term 2018 of the Software Engineering course.
 
## Installation
1. Get [Squeak 5.2 or later](http://www.squeak.org)
2. Load [Metacello](https://github.com/metacello/metacello)
3. Finally, load the package with the following command:

```
Metacello new
  baseline: 'IMAPClient';
  repository: 'github://hpi-swa-teaching/IMAPClient:develop/packages';
  load.
```

4. Now you can setup a Menu Entry under "Apps" using `ICFolderDialog install`.


## Open
You can open the tool with the command `ICFolderDialog new` or using a Menu Entry.

 ## Configuration
 You can customize the number of mails, which are fetched on the initial update process, and the number of mails which are loaded if you press the `Load older Mails` Button. Default are 100 and 10. Change `ICFolder>>numbersOfHeadersToFetch{AtLoaderOlderMail | AtTheBeginning}`

  - Display emails correctly (parse different encodings)

## Usage
Start the IMAP Client with `ICFolderDialog new`. Add new Accounts with the `+` Button. We tested the functionality with the HPI OWA Accounts. But other accounts should work fine.
``` 
Server: owa.hpi.de
Port: 993
Username: surname.lastname
Password: xxxxxxx
Use SSL: True
```

## Security
Your password isn't stored on disk, but visible to your Squeak environment. After closing the IMAP-Client and reopening it your are welcomed by a password prompt to re-enter your credentials.
