 - Display emails correctly (parse different encodings)

## Usage
Start the IMAP Client with `ICFolderDialog open`. Add new Accounts with the `+` Button. We tested the functionality with the HPI OWA Accounts. But other accounts should work fine.
``` 
Server: owa.hpi.de
Port: 993
Username: surname.lastname
Password: xxxxxxx
Use SSL: True
```

## Safety
You don't have to be worried about your passwords, of course we won't save them. After closing the IMAP-Client and reopening it your are welcomed by a password prompt to re-enter your credentials.
